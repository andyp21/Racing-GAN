# Racing-GAN
Research Multi-generator adversarial networks

Paper proposing a new model for generative adversarial networks coined ‘Racing-GAN’ which utilizes multiple generators and a modified loss function to speed up the convergence rate. 
See the pdf document for the research paper.
Findings were inconclusive and further research was discontinued due to extenuating circumstances with COVID-19.
